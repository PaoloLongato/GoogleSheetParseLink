# GoogleSheetParseLink
Populating Parse with content and modyfying such content by using Google Sheets can be a lot faster than editing Parse directly and a good intermediate testing step before you build a proper CMS for your apps.

This project is still at its infancy and its author does not claim a thorough knoledge of JavaScript, Google Script and even Google Sheets.  So do not get upset if you see some spagetti code.  It will, however, drammatically increase your speed of interaction with Parse, when you need to load content for consumption within the app.  It is not meant to replace a proper CMS but it will help hammering out your project requirements.  Please contribute!

Instructions:
1 - Crate Parse data types directly in GSheet
2 - Crate Parse Payload directly in GSheet
3 - Batch update works only if you GSheet has a veri specific structure.  Check out Example 1 below to see that [I have not figured out a way to read a SSheet user defined range and get it to output the result in certain user definec cells]
